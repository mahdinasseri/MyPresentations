In this presentation, I provide a comprehensive exploration of the business model canvas, drawing inspiration from the book "Business Model Generation" by Alexander Osterwalder. This slide deck has been crafted for entrepreneurial events, including Startup Weekends, and I have delivered it at numerous such gatherings.
