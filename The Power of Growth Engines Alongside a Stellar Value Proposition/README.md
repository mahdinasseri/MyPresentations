The Power of Growth Engines Alongside a Stellar Value Proposition

In this presentation, I emphasized that having an outstanding value proposition alone is not sufficient for the success of a startup. In addition to a compelling value proposition, you need an effective growth engine to propel and sustain your business.

I discussed the concept of growth engines and presented the four growth engines that Eric Ries mentioned in his book "[The Lean Startup](https://theleanstartup.com/)." These growth engines are essential for startups to drive sustainable and scalable growth.

Creating a powerful value proposition is just the beginning, and combining it with the right growth engine can be a game-changer for startups. Join me in this presentation to discover how these growth engines can be harnessed to ensure the long-term success of your startup.
