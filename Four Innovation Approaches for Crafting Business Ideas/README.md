# Four Innovation Approaches for Crafting Business Ideas

In this presentation, I've explored the essence of innovation based on the business model and elaborated on four core innovation pillars: Resource-Based Innovation, Value-Based Innovation, Customer-Centric Innovation, and Financial Resource-Based Innovation.

These four dimensions provide a comprehensive framework for generating innovative business ideas. The presentation draws heavily from the content of the book "Business Model Generation" by Osterwalder, which serves as a valuable resource in understanding the intricacies of business model innovation.

Join me as we delve into these four innovation approaches, discovering how they can guide the creation of unique and viable business ideas. By exploring these dimensions, you'll be better equipped to think creatively and strategically in your entrepreneurial endeavors.
